## The Advanced Concepts Modern Front End Developer Must Learn and Understand

Yes, every FE developer must know HTML, CSS, and JS – sure. But that is hardly
enough these days to really understand what’s going on in the fast-expanding
field of web applications development.

At the basic level, HTML/CSS/JS is all about the syntax. But just like learning
the alphabet and punctuation rules of a foreign human language doesn’t make you
a speaker in that language – similarly, it’s not the syntax that makes you a
developer.

The concepts that drive the modern FE development are strikingly the same that a
good BE developer must understand to implement solid server-side software:

-   SSL and session security

-   networking and client-server/browser-API communications

-   caching and memory management

-   multithreading and concurrency

-   common API formats

-   object-oriented programming

-   natural language processing
