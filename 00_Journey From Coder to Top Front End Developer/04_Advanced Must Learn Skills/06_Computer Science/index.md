## Object-Oriented Programming

The cornerstone of web development – DOM – is hierarchical, but *components*
bring more object-oriented flavor to the FE JS development. Components-based
models are usually attributed to popular frameworks, however, in reality, it’s
just a different method abstracting screen objects in the JS code vs. working
with them in DOM directly. So, the use of complete frameworks is not necessary
to start taking advantage of components: properties, instantiation, events,
communications. In JS, on-page components would be coded by *extending* the
*class* of base components available in the adopted distribution or framework.

## Natural Language Processing (NLP)

A general understanding of NLP can be beneficial when working with FE
localization and internationalization (i18s), as well as SEO – specifically, how
translations and text search work.
