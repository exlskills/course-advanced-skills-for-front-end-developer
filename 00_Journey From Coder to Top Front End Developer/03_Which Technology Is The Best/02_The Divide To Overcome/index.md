## Why Front End/Back End Divide Should Go Away

In a team structure, specialization is good for roles that require considerably
different skills and can either be performed without much interaction or can be
staffed with people who get along and communicate with each other well. The
FE/BE separation doesnâ€™t fit this profile: the skills are fundamentally
interchangeable and overlapping, implementation patterns crisscross both ends,
and typical developers are bad and unwilling communicators. The latter issue is
particularly damaging for international teams spread over regions and time
zones: rather than communicate and collaborate, the developers would make
assumptions and one-sided decisions, negatively affecting the success of the
project. Breaking the barrier without sacrificing the technology footprint and
quality can be a difficult task, but beneficial in the end.
