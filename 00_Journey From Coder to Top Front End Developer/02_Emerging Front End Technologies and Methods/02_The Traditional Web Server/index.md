## Are We Forgetting The Traditional Web Server?

The traditional web applications design in which the browser acts as a thin FE
client responsible for passing each (well, most) user clicks from to the server
and painting the next page as per the HTML/CSS received back is still around. By
estimates, the vast majority of existing apps use this approach, but itâ€™s not as
popular currently for new app development.

In addition to complete legacy, there is a number of popular and fairly modern
Back End frameworks that can be utilized cost-effectively and produce
contemporary-looking sites. As with many technologies, if there is still
reasonably-priced hardware available to run legacy stacks on, the sites that
work well will remain on them.

The fact is that the SPA cannot handle in-browser page painting effectively for
all types of applications on all devices, so the on-server HTML generation will
hardly go away completely anytime soon. Back to the point that the look and feel
is not the biggest issue FE developers have to deal with, the importance of
right FE-BE balance is only growing.
