## One Other Thing – Content Delivery Networks (CDN)

In the not so remote past, an average website physically hosted on a particular
geographical continent would be hard to reach from other continents – due to the
high latency of the network pipes. Doesn’t seem to be a problem anymore – the
networks and distributions improved tremendously. Of course, applications that
require high network speed such as streaming or video conferencing do work
better when the communicating entities are in relative physical proximity to
each other, but for generic web apps, the latency of the *last mile* may outway
fine-tuning at the global network level. So, CDNs with multiple distribution
points across the covered geography are beneficial, but only to a certain extent
and more so for certain types of applications. CDNs are surely good if they are
cost-effective and easy to use.
